A modern currency converter web application built with React & Tailwind CSS.

FluxRate Converter is a sleek, responsive, single-page web app that allows users to convert currencies in real-time using live exchange rates from a public API.
The design uses a Liquid Glass / macOS-inspired UI with light and dark modes, optimized for desktop and mobile screens.
